## introduction
Lately I've been playing around with the age old question of "why". I'm not talking about questioning everything in the universe and why it works the way it does either, but rather looking into myself and my personal motivations. *Why am I doing this?* If we look deeper into that, we can often rephrase that question to what am I hoping to achieve by doing this? Once the goal is a little bit clearer, we can start looking at the how. All of this may seem obvious and in a way, it really is, but we don't always take enough time to reflect on it, or at least I don't. Looking back on my journey so far, I definitely feel like I've learned a lot. At the same time, I never truly took the time to make a solid game plan when I started learning how to code and I could've likely achieved a lot more if I did. So in an effort to take a step back so I can move forward more efficiently, this series offers a look at some of the big WHY's in my coding journey and HOW that influenced the path I took. 

## The very first why

I decided to start learning how to code just under a year and a half ago, give or take (a.k.a. Spring 2018). Usually when I tell people about it, I'll say it was "simply because I was bored" and while that's not entirely false, it doesn't give the full picture either. Sure, being bored was a big part of it, probably even the trigger that started it all, but I could've done a million other things if my only reason was that. So why coding? A culmination of things starting with the basic fact that I like learning new things and understanding how stuff works. I've always had a bit of a fascination with technology, though up until adulthood that manifested mainly in having a better understanding and grasp of the software everyone was supposed to know (*cough*  Windows Office *cough*). My presentations and documents looked better than those of my peers because I took the time to figure out how much I could customize and to see what I could do beyond the basics of what we were taught. When I made a full PowerPoint game as part of my thesis for my degree in Education, using a bunch of hyperlinks of course, I never could have imagined I would call myself a coder six years later. It just didn't occur to me at the time because I was on a different path and to me, my slightly advanced technological skills (compared to my direct peers, that is) didn't seem that impressive. Then over two years ago, I landed in a situation that moved me halfway across the world with the luxury to choose what I want to do. In all of the chaos surrounding that situation, I count myself lucky that I got a chance to reinvent myself. The thing is, I was lost with really no clue at all what direction I wanted to go in. I had time on my hands and I figured "why not try coding and see if I like it?". Writing this now and being forced to look back, I realize I didn't really give myself enough credit. I fully expected, even tried to convince myself, that even if I liked it, I might not even be good at it. Now you might be thinking "what is the point of this story?". Well the point is that in essence I started learning how to code just to see if I liked it. Since me still being here and doing this obviously proves I do, it didn't take me long to realize that. Beyond that, I had no real clear goal so I kept on learning because I was enjoying myself, but as you can imagine, it's been a bit of a strange journey with me wandering around, hoping to find that one thing I'm looking for.  Spoiler alert: I still haven't figured it out 100% because let's be honest, the tech world is gigantic and there's so many options for a career as a developer. Saying I'm only interested in web dev, my current "main" path, would be a lie. I tend to have a busy brain and once it gets stuck on a project, it's doesn't always let go. The good news is, all of those projects are related to coding, so I know I've found something I'm passionate about and right now - for me - that's all that matters. As long as I take a moment to think about why I'm doing what I'm doing, what I'm hoping to achieve so I know I'm moving forward and not backwards or sideways, I know I'll figure it out.

### End note:

If you're still reading at this point, a sincere thank you and if you take anything away from part 1 of my story, I hope it's this: 
- *For any newbies, you don't need to be a tech whiz to decide to start coding.*
- *Don't sell yourself short when setting goals.*
- *Take a moment every now and again to reflect, it might save you time later.*
