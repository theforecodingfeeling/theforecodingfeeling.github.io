If you happened to have read my intro to this little series, you know that the first time I booted up the Windows OS of my dual-boot after using only the Linux OS for over a year, it didn't go so well. *[Side note: if you haven't read the intro article and want to, just click the handy little link above.]* It took way too long after logging in until I was able to perform any kind of action besides some limited and pointless mouse movement. On top of that, I had to watch a couple of new windows that were pretty useless pop up, obviously slowing down the start up process. Needless to say, I needed to clean it up ASAP. 

### Step 1 - Lose all the bloatware. 
-----------------------------------------------
Let's face it, Windows - no matter what version, or at least the ones this millennial has known in her lifetime - come installed with a bunch of things that I knew I was never going to use. Since at that point I didn't have any knowledge on how to navigate Windows using the command line yet, I made it easy on myself and made use of my new Windows 10 environment the smart way: using the GUI and more specifically, the start menu and search bar. Now that I was actually paying attention to the start menu, I was honestly quite surprised by how full it was stuffed. Remember, I was used to Linux' clean environment with its "basics only" mentality toward what comes pre-installed and my brain very much appreciates that minimalism. So the first thing I did was clean up everything in my start menu, beginning with right clicking and uninstalling whatever I didn't want on my computer at all and unpinning whatever I did but didn't need quick access to. In the former category were about four games taking up quite some space, an antivirus I wasn't going to use and probably a ton more software I've already forgotten about. A lot of what gets pre-pinned in the start menu also dissappeared in favor of a sleeker look displaying exactly what I need quick access to and nothing more. Once I was satisfied with that, I took a last peak at my full list of software to make any other uninstalls I deemed necessary.

### Step 2 - Take a look at start up processes.
-----------------------------------------------
I needed to fix all those unwanted pop up windows I mentioned before from preventing the rest of the system to properly work untill they were finished starting up. It didn't take me long using Ctrl + Alt + Delete and navigating to the processes tab to figure out one in particular had a high priority and a couple of others needed to get some adjustments, but all in all it was about two min of work (important work though!). I restarted my laptop, booted up my Windows and lo and behold, it now starts up a lot faster, yeay! 

### Step 3 - Finish desktop modification.
-----------------------------------------------
#### 3.1 - Taskbar Unpinned
Now that my Windows was stripped down and my start menu looking a lot better, it was time to complete the look by doing some last touch-ups. The first thing was the task bar, which had been left mainly untouched, so again I unpinned whatever I didn't want on there (because let's be honest, I'm not using Microsoft Edge unless purely for testing purposes or to install FireFox/Chrome). 

### 3.2 Install browsers and editor (and Spotify)
The two things I use the most as a developer, so obviously that was the first thing I needed to install. For browsers, I downloaded both Mozilla FireFox and Google Chrome Dev, the latter of which I use as my main browser, but if I'm working on a project, I usually have it open in both of those so I can spot any cross-browser issues easily. I have to admit that I only ever really use Internet Explorer/Microsoft edge in my final testing phase, maybe not the best process but oh well. As far as my editor goes, I chose to try out Brackets after using only VSCode ever since I started coding with my own editor instead of an online one. Since this whole Windows experiment is meant to be a comparison of operating systems, I figured a little more experimenting for research sake wouldn't hurt. I'm also the type of person who listens to music pretty much no matter what I'm doing - cleaning, reading, writing a blog post writing code, learning, ... - so downloading Spotify for me was a must. I switch back and forth between all my devices too so I can keep listening (just to say I need it!). Pinned all of those to the taskbar and made shortcut icons on my desktop so I have access in different ways. 

### 3.3 Completing the look.
You might have noticed that my start menu above wasn't just looking slimmed down, but also got a new color. Now that my desktop enironment was starting to look a little more functional, fitting my needs (at least so far since a lot still needs to be installed later), I couldn't help but play around with the look of it. I know to some people it ultimately doesn't matter much, but if I'm going to be working on my laptop every day like I've been doing, then I find it important that it motivates me and that it doesn't make my head hurt too much when looking at the screen to long. Hence, why I spent some time picking out the right color for me (and that might change over time) and a background to complete the entire look. Now I know that if I log into my account, there's a desktop waiting for me ready to go to work, because that's what is was designed to do.
