### Approximately 1.5y BW (Before Windows)

When I first started learning to code, I decided to take the self-teaching path. So far I haven't changed my mind, so I don't really know what approach bootcamps or other coding courses take, but most online courses use an online editor. That meant I didn't really require anything besides a browser. On top of that, thanks to a lot of cross-platform availability, I could usually work on my computer, my phone or switch between both, making learning even easier. While it certainly has its perks, inevitably I realized it's not very representative of coding "the right way", meaning in your local dev environment. *[Side note: namely why - as a former teacher -  I'm not a huge fan of this approach, but that's another discussion.]*

So I did my research on everything I needed to consider and the first thing is pretty much choosing what OS to use. I didn't have an Apple device or a real interest in iOS development so that basically left me with Windows, Linux or a mix of both. Windows would have been easiest in a way since that's all I'd ever used up to that point, so I had it readily available. However, as a code newbie, Linux, which is considered to be somewhat more user-friendly and has the advantage of being free and open source, seemed slightly less intimidating to start with. I found on old laptop that hadn't been used in a while and therefore wouldn't be missed and wiped it clean. Since I wanted the advantage of having two full OS systems and I had the luxury of being able to play around a bit without too much worry, I took on the project of making it a dual boot system and I'm sure glad I did. I've been enjoying working within my Linux environment for a while now and I never had to worry about doing anything that would cause issues within my Windows environment since they're separate, which is something I didn't know I would appreciate this much (but learning command line tends to mean some mistakes ...). 

So there I was, a couple of weeks prior to writing this article, perfectly happy with my Linux and no real intention of working with Windows. Then my love of teaching and circumstances kind of combined and inspiration hit, which in turn made my brain go wild and thus started the idea for a project. Since it's still very much a work in progress and partly an exercise in conquering Impostor Syndrome (just like this blog), I'm not going to share much more at this point. I hope it's a nice teaser though (and putting it out there in the world, even as vaguely as this is a step for me, small as it may be). All you need to know right now is that it exposed me to a big hole in my knowledge with a super simple fix. I couldn't really write anything about Windows because I wasn't familiar with it from a developer's perspective, but all I had to do was build out my own Windows environment, which had been mainly left untouched so far.

### 0 AF (After Windows) 

I can't lie, the first time I booted up my Windows again, I literally groaned at how slow it was. Granted, I'm working on a laptop that was considered old when I wiped it and I'm still using it, so it has every right to be somewhat slow. Despite its age and the fact that I significantly altered it though, I've never once considered my Linux environment slow and it's been in use extensively. It took about five minutes, give or take before I could even attempt to use my Windows and I spent most of it watching different screens pop up. Suffice to say it wasn't my idea of a good start to my little Windows project and it would need some tweaking if I didn't want to be driven to insanity (I'm not very patient, but hey, at least I know it). Even though it had a bumpy start, so far, I don't regret my decision. To find out more about how I've been building out my Windows dev environment to fit my needs, be sure to check out the rest of the series "Working with Windows". I hope to see you there.
